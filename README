This is an iPhone app to reconfigure certain versions of openiboot to toggle
features such as auto-boot, default OS and the timeout before they boot.

WARNING: This could seriously damage your iDevice. Do not use if you don't know
	 what it is!

Requirements

This requires a SPECIFIC version of openiboot to be installed. I will be
maintaining a version compatible on my github until the changes reach planetbeing's
master repo. Apocolipse's openiboot should be compatible too.

Usage

The application will autmatically back up the settings upon first boot
however at this current stage I highly recommend dumping a copy of your NVRAM
using 'nvram -x -p | /var/nvram.plist'. I would also advise dumping your NOR
from the openiboot console as openiboot is a bit brutish with the NVRAM currently.
